# Virtual Mouse using OpenCV and Mediapipe
ðŸš€ Project Overview
                 This project implements a Virtual Mouse system using OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI. By tracking hand gestures and finger positions, this system allows users to control their computer's mouse without any physical hardware! It's a great demonstration of computer vision techniques applied to real-world use cases.

# Key Features:
- Tracks hand and finger movements using Mediapipe Hands.
- Allows smooth cursor movement.
- Supports left-click, double-click, and scroll functionalities based on hand gestures.
- Integrates PyAutoGUI to simulate mouse actions.
# Tech Stack:
- Python
- OpenCV for image processing.
- Mediapipe for hand landmark detection.
- PyAutoGUI for simulating mouse events.
# How It Works:
- Index finger moves the mouse cursor.
- Thumb and index finger pinch triggers a single-click.
- Index and middle finger pinch triggers a double-click.
- Open palm gestures trigger scroll actions.
